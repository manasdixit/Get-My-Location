# Get-my-location

I Used reverse Geo-coding and the fetch location API's for this project. This Web-application gets the exact location of a user by taking latitude and longitude as inputs. I used the reverse geo-coding API to get the location data and the fetch-API to get the country data such as flag, population, currency and much more. I then displayed this data in the UI which has a nice component (flag, country name, region, population, language and currency.
